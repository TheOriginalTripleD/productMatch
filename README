Requires Python 3.3.6 or higher.

To run productMatch:

./productMatch.py [-l listingFile] [-p productFile] [-t processors] outputFile

The only required argument is a file for output, although I recommend setting
the number of processors your machine has in order to take advantage of
multithreading (the default is 2).

By default it will read "data/listings.txt" for the listings and
"data/products.txt" for the products. These can be overridden with the "-l"
and "-p" flags, respectively.

There also exists a second script for testing purposes:

./processTest.py [-l lower] [-u upper]

which will run "productMatch" with variant numbers of processors in order for
you too see which number yields an optimum time. For example, to test the
program with 2 through 10 processors:

./processTest.py -l 2 -u 10
