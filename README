Requires Python 3.3.6 or higher.

To simply run productMatch all you need to type is:

   ./productMatch.py outputFile

Where "outputFile" is the file you are going to store your JSON output in.
There are, however, a few more options available to you:

      -l pathToListingFile : Allows you to choose which file you will get the
                             listing data from. Default is "data/listings.txt"
                             
      -p pathToProductsFile : Choose a specific file to get the product data
                              from. Default is "data/products.txt"

      -t processes : Number of processes that the program should spawn to
                     handle to data. Generally works best if you choose the
                     number of processors on your CPU, as numbers higher than
                     this show increasingly diminishing returns. Default is 2.

After the program is finished running, it will print out to following:

      Matches : Listings were matched with a product
      Ambiguous : Listings that matched with two or more products.
      No Match : Listings that did not match any product

In addition to productMatch.py, there is a second script, processTest.py, which
can be used for testing purposes:

./processTest.py [-l lower] [-u upper]

which will run "productMatch" with variant numbers of processors in order for
you too see which number yields an optimum time. For example, to test the
program with 2 through 10 processors:

./processTest.py -l 2 -u 10
